# Laravel & PHP Guidelines for AI Code Assistants

<!-- generated by ai-instructions-pilot: sets: go, laravel -->

## Code Style

- Prefer clear, idiomatic Go over clever code.
- Keep functions small and focused; avoid long parameter lists.
- Use package-level comments to describe purpose and responsibilities.
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction; simplicity beats generality in Go.

## Error Handling

- Return errors explicitly; no exceptions.
- Use `errors.Is` and `errors.As` for wrapping and inspection.
- Avoid ignoring errors with `_`; always handle them appropriately.

## Concurrency

- Use goroutines and channels for concurrency; prefer structured concurrency patterns.
- Avoid shared mutable state; use synchronization primitives carefully.
- Always clean up goroutines (e.g., context cancellation).

## Testing

- Write table-driven tests.
- Use `t.Helper()` in helper functions.
- Benchmark performance-critical code with `testing.B`.
- Keep test classes in the same file when possible.
- Use descriptive test method names.
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.

## Documentation & Comments

- Use GoDoc style comments: `// FunctionName ...` before exported symbols.
- Keep comments factual and concise.
- Document package-level behavior and assumptions.

## Core Laravel Principle

Follow Laravel conventions first. If Laravel has a documented way to do something, use it. Only deviate when there is a clear justification.

## PHP Standards

- Follow PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-12.
- Use camelCase for non-public-facing strings.
- Use short nullable notation: `?string` not `string|null`.
- Always specify `void` return types when methods return nothing.

## Class Structure

- Use typed properties, not docblocks.
- Use constructor property promotion when all properties can be promoted.
- Use one trait per line.

## Type Declarations & Docblocks

- Use typed properties over docblocks.
- Specify return types including `void`.
- Use short nullable syntax: `?Type` not `Type|null`.
- Document iterables with generics using `@return Collection<int, User>` style.

## Docblock Rules

- Don't use docblocks for fully type-hinted methods unless a description is needed.
- Always import classnames in docblocks — never use fully qualified names.
- Use one-line docblocks when possible: `/** @var string */`.
- Most common type should be listed first in multi-type docblocks.
- If one parameter needs a docblock, add docblocks for all parameters.
- For iterables, always specify key and value types.
- Use array shape notation for fixed keys, with each key on its own line.

## Control Flow

- Handle error conditions first, success case last (happy path last).
- Avoid `else` statements — use early returns.
- Prefer multiple simple `if` statements over compound conditions.
- Always use curly braces, even for single statements.
- Each ternary part on its own line unless very short.

## Laravel Conventions

## Strings & Formatting

- Prefer string interpolation over concatenation.

## Enums

- Use PascalCase for enum values.

## Comments

- Avoid comments — write expressive code instead.
- Use proper formatting for necessary comments.
- Refactor comments into descriptive function names.

## Whitespace

- Add blank lines between logical statements for readability.
- Avoid extra empty lines between `{}` brackets.
- Keep sequences of equivalent single-line operations grouped.
- Let code breathe — avoid cramped formatting.

## Validation

- Use array notation for multiple rules for readability.
- Custom validation rules use snake_case.

## Blade Templates

- Indent with 4 spaces.
- No spaces after control structures.

## Authorization

- Policies use camelCase: `Gate::define('editPost', ...)`.
- Use CRUD verbs, but `view` instead of `show`.

## Translations

- Use the `__()` function over `@lang`.

## API Routing

- Use plural resource names: `/errors`.
- Use kebab-case: `/error-occurrences`.
- Avoid deep nesting for clarity and simplicity.

## Quick Reference

## Migrations

- Only implement `up()` methods; leave out `down()` unless rollback is required.

## Code Quality Reminders

- Use typed properties over docblocks.
- Prefer early returns over nested if/else.
- Use constructor property promotion when all properties can be promoted.
- Avoid `else` statements when possible.
- Use string interpolation over concatenation.
- Always use curly braces for control structures.
